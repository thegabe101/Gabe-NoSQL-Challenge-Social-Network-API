## Description

This was a back-end project focused on creating the supporting database for a social media app API. The theory of a fullstack application using this API would be to create a social media network allowing users to react to and post thoughts, a la Twitter.

- The motivation behind creating this project was further developing backend skills and working with two new pieces of tech, Mongoose ORM and MongoDB. This was our class' introduction to NoSQL, a powerful database methodology that is less rigid but with it's own quirks when put side by side with traditional MySQL. Throughout class we have been focused on the integration between front and back-end- this is precisely where SQL of any type comes into play. Although no front-end was created for this project, by developing our back-end skills, we are still able to envision how one might proceed with a full-stack application in this light.

## Installation

- Because there is no front end, this code must be run via node.js. Should you want to run it and try it yourself, feel free to clone the repo, and make sure to npm init and install all dependencies. You can then start the server and test out the database yourself using an application like Insomnia to check that data is being routed and retrieved properly.

## Usage

- There is no method of usage in the sense of utility for this app at the moment. It is purely for testing purposes. However, it is important to keep in mind when testing that a database such as this one could theoretically back a social media network of a developer's choosing. Usage would require creating a front-end and further developing the NoSQL side of the database to match all functionality.
